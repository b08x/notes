* trying to improve the integrity of the 5GHz wireless connection
	* setting channel width to 40
	* channel to 40
		* ext channel to uppper (ideally to cover a broader range)

=== this increased signal quality from about 20-30% to ~50% according to the status page.. â€¢ -90dmb to -85dbm ===

* ~~[] trying bumping to tx power from 20 to 23~~
* [x] setting protection mode to RTS
	* this ensures connections are complelted before data is transmitted, otherwise packets just fly all over the place
* [x] enable rts threshold
	* this is the max packet size before the proctection mentioned above is enabled
* [x] enable short preamble
	* its like the tip of the data...devices need this to transfer data, also, enabling this reduces header size
