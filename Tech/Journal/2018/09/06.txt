===== A Deeper Dive on Raspberry Pi Speech: More Options =====

**Modifying the Voice**

The Espeak package provides a few good variations to the default voice used to speak out the text.  The software supports [[http://espeak.sourceforge.net/languages.html|more than 30 languages]] and a few of them are shown below.  The syntax is “**-v<voice filename>”  For example, we can use an American accent with “****en-us”:**

'''
espeak -ven-us "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

Or we can use a French accent with “**fr”:**

'''
espeak -vfr "Ce tutoriel de Dexter vous souhaite la bienvenue" 2>/dev/null
'''

Or we can speak Spanish with the Raspberry Pi using the term “es”**:**

'''
espeak -ves "Bienvenido al tutorial de Dexter" 2>/dev/null
'''

**Voices**

You can also specify a male voice, or a female voice.   You can choose between a few different male voices :**+m1,+m2,+m3,+m4,+m5,+m6,+m7.  **For example, we can speak in male voice five:

'''
espeak -ven+m5 "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

You can also use female voices: **+f1,+f2,+f3,+f4**. For example, we can speak in female voice four:

'''
espeak -ven+f4 "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

You can also modify a few other aspects of the voice with **+croak, +whisper.** For example, we can whisper:

'''
espeak -ven+whisper "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

**Modifying Speech Speed **

The “-s” parameter controls the speed of reading a single word. It sets the speed in words-per-minute. The default value is 175. I generally use a faster speed of 260. The lower limit is 80. There is no upper limit, but about 500 is probably a practical maximum.  We can set the word speed like this:

**Fast at 300 words per minute:  **

'''
espeak -s250 "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

**Or slow at 80 words per minute:**

'''
espeak -s80 "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

**Pause Between Words**

We can use the “-g” to pause between words; the “g” stands for “word gap”. This option inserts a pause between words. The value is the length of the pause, in units of 10 ms (at the default speed of 170 wpm). A fast pause:

'''
espeak -g10 "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

A slow pause with 100 ms between words:

'''
espeak -g180 "Welcome to Dexter tutorial" 2>/dev/null
'''

There are lot more options available with the eSpeak package you can review [[http://espeak.sourceforge.net/commands.html|here]].
