from linux midi orchstration...
[ jamin compression settings ] - a good baseline

for my ears, a good default setting for jamins' multiband compression reduces the threshold to -20db, a ratio set at 2:1 and knee at 0.5 (knee doesn't really seem to translate to any of the other plugins as values range from 0 - 1 )

attacks set to the low end of the

from audio engineering in a nutshell;

When using a compressor for the first time, switch its attack and release controls to
"automatic".

Set the threshold to "max" (= neutral) and decide whether you want strong (5:1 and up)
or gentle compression (1.5:1 - 5:1).

Move the threshold down until you begin to hear the desired effect.

Calibrate the output gain so that the processed signal is as loud as the original, using the
bypass switch.

Now turn the attack and release knobs to the middle and switch to manual control.

Use the attack time to control how much transients will be compressed. If the signal is too
thin over all with very loud drum hits, use a short attack time to reduce them. If drums
sound lifeless and squashed, set a longer attack.

If the compressor is "pumping" (i.e. loud transients are followed by a dent in loudness),
reduce the release time.
When compressing stereo signals, make sure you link the control voltages for both
channels (most unit



	Knee: how harshly the compression sets in.
	seems a higher kneee setting smooths out the the compression starting at the threshold....
	  will look into setting knee higher, it seems to make sense a less aburpt shift in sound....

Re-acclimatising your ear can help take in the whole picture:

20: Sub
63: Bass
200: Low mids
630: Mids
2000: Upper mids
6300: Treble
20000: Air

lowering the shelf....
so then a realtive boost, that doesn't go above the shelf (say set at -6db)
