@sfz @eq

working on patch paramaters to ideally limit amount of eq/filters required later down the path...

since we're using linuxsampler as the engine to use sfz files;  check what "opcodes" are supported

in regards to panning;

"Works, but can be fine-tuned. sfzplayer uses L=cos((100 + pan) / 200 * pi / 2) * sqrt(2), Dimension LE uses L=sqrt((100 - x) / 100), but LS uses a line segment approximation measured from GigaStudio, which lies somewhere between to other two."

this tells me that panning should be left out of the sfz file and can be adjusted in the mixer....
