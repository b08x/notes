Things are going well. 

I suppose, acceptinng a self challenge to continue the amp methods on "the outside" or is it inside? 
Anyway, this time with more focus on emotional control and maintaining a truly postive attitude. Without pot this seems to going much better in this regard. While a bit weary, I feel sharp. 

Ha. I had several hours of great conversation with myself today, ya know realizing stuff. The best part is I don't really direcly remember the specifics, just knowing I need to keep a few things in mind; 

getting over my attachment (in this case to Ann). 

maintaining composure with faced with structure, or opposition. striking a different type of balance. 

avoiding despair...remembering, as far as im concerned "i won" in the sense of finally being sure of Ann's love. Everything else can wait. Time no longer should control my actions... which means I can slow down and do things right. 

I'm going to stop now. Before I overwhelm myself with 10,000 ideas/goals. Keeping it simple. Keep my head down. Get out of here. That's it, for now.
