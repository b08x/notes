Hello!

The accompanying resume is in response to your listing for a Front Office Agent. I believe that my background in IT as well as my excellent customer service skills, make me an strong candidate for this position. 

As my resume hopefully shows, I have many qualities that will contribute to the success of 'The Joesph', including the following: 

* Skillful at resolving complex issues
* An effective communicator
* Desire and aptitude for learning new things 
* Able to adapt to changing environments
* Doing all of the above with a positive demeanor

My work record reflects a variety of positions in which I managed increased responsibility to great effect. I feel I would thrive in a positive environment where working with fellow travelers is the primary responsibility. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you to discuss how my experience will best meet the needs of potential teammates as well as clients.
