====== Friday 21 Dec 2018 ======

The end is near. I'm holding on to this false hope that someone will say 'hey, let's execute the plan' and begin work. This is rediciulous. Ann is rediculous.  I can't take her anymore. I'm not interested in other "humans". I'm tired of their bullshit. Their constant yelling without thinking. I'm not interested in being part of an experiment anymore. I have no point. I have no purpose. There is no reason for me to keep sitting here. Nothing is going to change this weekend. Ann is going to be her usual useless self. She is going to say nothing of substance. She is going to act depressed. She is going to lecture me. She is going to continue to manipulate me. So, since I really have no desire to kill myself either. What I'm going to look forward to is a one last weekend just relaxing. Smoking a nice little bowl and watching a movie, pretending I have a friend for a couple hours. Then I'm going to find an overpass high enough and with enough traffic for me to jump from. To make sure not only the height will kill but also as a final touch, enough high speed traffic and that mangle this pathetic meat sac beyond repair. I dont care where I end up.
