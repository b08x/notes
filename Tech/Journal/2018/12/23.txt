====== Sunday 23 Dec 2018 ======

I miss her so much. Yesterday was so much fun. I loved how we talked. I think we were really talking, listening. It was very genuine. This is my sister that I remember. A bright little purple grape. 

Now that I'm trying to reframe this whole thing as help since the beginning, maybe perhaps that's part of why there was a lack of anger when Ann said she needed time alone. I'm only frustrated because I do remember the good parts and it breaks my heart for Ann to ever view me as some sort of monster she's afraid of. 

I guess it's been a month since the accident. A month since leaving the relationship as we knew it. It's been a long month. 

It felt really good to hug her again and tell her that I love her and to hear it back. The idea of 'the compound' is difficult to conceptualize so it takes away a lot of the hope and motivation. Ann was very encouraging and supportive. It was a delight to hear her laugh. 

I guess I still dont trust that when she says 'alone time' that it really just means 'i dont want to be around you'. I wish my head would not take it this way. 

Oh well. I'm trying to enjoy being stoned. The past two days have felt nice in that regard. Just actually relaxing and taking in the soundscapes or day dreaming about songs and paintings.
