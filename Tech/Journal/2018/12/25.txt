====== Tuesday 25 Dec 2018 ======

Still not sure if I should kill myself. If it was as easy as hitting a button, I'm sure I would. 

I'm fairly certain the only reason I'm hanging on is this fantasy of a certain relationship with Ann, a relationship which, all signs point to being in the past. Or a missed opportunity. Of course the way I saw it was never an opportunity, but now of course I had one and lost it. It's no wonder I'm so bitter. 

This whole cigarette thing is obnoxious. I have no more desire for a cigarette as I do a good movie to watch. I feel lonely and am waiting for a rejection from Andrea regarding my proposal for coloring today. Maybe the rejection will motivate me to finally end this. I'm not going to try to corner her in her lies again. It's too easy for one, and it also endlessly frustrating because she is also a socio path in the sense she can caught in a flat out lie and she will still deny. I hate unintentional rhymes like that. Oh well. 

I have nothing to write about, nothing to sing about, nothing to do anything about. Why would I want to keep going like this? Why continue? For the glimmer of false hope for some brief reprieve every once in a while. 

I'm back to where I was before. Which is; without an idea as to what to really do with myself. Not paying attention to any of the crap around me, I can in fact, do anything I please. The big black people dont scare me anymore if anything they annoy me. 

So now I'll watch some porn and masturbate, which will take about as long and be about as satisfying as a cigarette. It'll be a different version of how I fantasize about Ann.
