@intentions

What am I doing now. I don't know and I have no idea. Which, I'm pretty sure used to be a terrifying feeling attached to this notion. 

Thoughts that appear as external visual. 

Also, trying not to ignore the soundscape but reframe. Which involves ignoring from time to time. A lot of the time. Otherwise. 

The tone..and the negative spectrum. I'll ignore it and explore it for myself. 

Rules. Well. 

Literal 

"Let's see"...should now be, "I'm going to think."

Now, not paying attention to projected sense of urgency. Relating to the rules, I have needed to follow to get better. And the policy to no longer follow them. Rules and things. If I dont like them, leave it. Well now that I can take care of myself, I dont have to take shit anymore. For a small number of units of measured time, perhaps.
