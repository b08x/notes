Many thoughts to keep in order. I still hold on, or "remember", that despite my circling around with how the future will unfold, I do know that things will be ok with Ann. Any fears or concerns that pass through, contradict previous expierences where the situations the brain feared the most were benign. 

My life has simplified to a point where my primary conerns include making music and pouring coffee. 

Fiending for a nap. But realizing that the effort I am putting in for the sake of Ann (for the sake?) is the same effort she puts into me...this is an idea that really doesn't sink in right away even though I know its true. I think it partly has to do with the fact that for many units of time spent alone left me thinking that she wasn't as interested in me as I her. I hope progress is made in our conversations today.
