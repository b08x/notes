====== Thursday 03 Jan 2019 ======

Being able to recongize then pass through the emotions is what I believe I'm practicing today. Todays tasks and actions were the same as yesterday, same inputs and all. However today is postively neutral. 

I look forward to seeing Ann today. I'm fairly certain that because now I'm consciously thinking about it, I'll be nervous when she arrives. Which, is to be expected and is a good kind of nervous. Her presence still brings along with that feeling of love which then sort of translates into this sort of shyness. This puts a smile on my face. I'm not sure yet what we could discuss. I was thinking about that animation.
