====== Monday 07 Jan 2019 ======

I think things have been going really well with Ann lately. We've been able to talk things out and I've been able to keep my composure to a certain degree. 

Today I feel blah again. Maybe the caffeine hasn't kicked in yet. I slept all day yesterday, which was kind of nice. It was nice to not have to do or say anything. Sitting at the coffee shop trying to figure out what to do with myself today. I don't feel very comfortable. Certainly not comfortable enough to get into a compositioin flow. 

I want to make sure I go see Ann today. Right now the idea the going up north, hanging out for an hour or so then taking the bus back isn't the greatest idea I can think of. But I want to make sure I don't start taking her for granted. I want to make sure I take every oppurtunty to spend time with her and enjoy it.

So, at the moment I suppose I'm toying with this concept of how I feel right now as being "neutral". Which, isn't a bad thing. I do find myself though, tetering on the edge of the negative side of the spectrum. Kind of letting this current disposition allow habitual thoughts of depair quash my motivation. So, another excerise I can do right now is try to get into some composition, even though I'm really "feeling it". I think this is where I usually tell myself I need adderall to get going, but in fact I don't. I just ordered a coffee with a shot of espresso, which I think should do the trick. â˜º
