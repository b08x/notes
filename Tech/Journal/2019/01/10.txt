Im nervous about something, but am not sure what. What happened...What am I trying to focus on?

The creative mind. 

Creating my own environment. No. this doesn't make any sense. I forget, these are just passing thoughts...

I'm not sure what I'm trying to focus on. 

Tense, I suppose. 

I guess I'm trying not to be afraid. 

impatience masking itself as aneixty

Well here I am. Again, not sure how I got here, but I don't let this particular detail of the moment get me down. I know that I am "here" because of progress.
