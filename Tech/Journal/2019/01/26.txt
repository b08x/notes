====== Saturday 26 Jan 2019 ======

At the moment I'm emotionally whelmed, so I think of a moive to watch so as to be distracted from this. Looking at the bag of food stuffs Ann and I aquired seemed to be fodder for this sense of longing. Memories of these trips where we'd return together and retire to our comfy little space. I guess this usually leaves me feeling rather sad because for some reason I'll tell myself and then believe that we'll never be able to do that again. I suppose in order for the situation to be optimal, a different more patient approach is necessary. I still couldn't explain how one would "learn" patience. I was and sometimes still am seemingly incapable of the notion. The sense of things can all fall apart an in instance never goes away it seems. I'd like to think that all this time attempting to manage stress in much more stressful environments than a comfy nest with Ann will lead to a sustainable nest. I dont know why I focus on writing a draft of anything "perfectly". These crackers aren't as salty as I'd care for them to be. Technically this is the most disappointing part of my day today, which is to say, pretty good. I didn't struggle around Ann today, which I hope is a contining trend not a once in while happenstance.
