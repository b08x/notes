emotions make you react 


My notion isn't necessary to recommend this method for folks. I have a method though that works for me which is to take particular substances ( in my case caffeine and amphetamines ) which amplify emotions, then recognize the emotion for what it is and use the power of thought and choice to determine my behavior. That's not to say this method doesn't have its drawbacks (which it does) however for me the benefits outweigh the negative. So yeah, its kind of like digging yourself out of a well by digging further down. Depending on what one can tolerate, you can in fact dig yourself out to the other side. I've been able to prove to myself that while substances can influence behavior, they are not fully in control..YOU are. 

beneficial to examine and then to choose reaction.
