I find myself creatively uninspired. I find this unsettling as it lends to these feelings of "worthlessness" or "bordem"...one of those. Right now I don't really have anything to commuicate to the outside world and this leaves me sort of dry. So I sit here, slugging coffee, waiting. Not sure what I'm waiting for, which also frustrates. I'm relatively content with my decisions to exit environments that we're draining my energy. Not only draining, but infecting with this coarseness that I just won't tolerate. I'm still unsure of how the future will prove to be "worth it". I have a difficult time imagining that I can extract any sort of enjoyment from living. I find it difficult to be alone. I find it difficult to be around people. I find it difficult to truely articulate thoughts and feelings. I find it difficult to maintain any sort of interest. I wish I could find some inspiration in Kerouac's tales in "on the road". He seems so unafraid of things that seem to eat away at my well-being. Picking up a bus, traversing to Chicago. Somehow ( I think this is an era thing that doesn't apply anymore ) just picking up a "room at the Y" for the night, and being content with walking around taking in sights and sounds. He talks about the emergence of "bop" or bebop, I'm assuming ( Charlie Parker, etc) and it's a romantic notion, like the notions of hobbit holes in Lord of the Rings. This comfortable existance, taking in these sensations. 

 “Because there is nothing better to spur creativity than a blank page or an empty bedroom,” he said.

I find this notion intimindating.
