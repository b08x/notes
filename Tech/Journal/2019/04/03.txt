I keep wishing she'd walk through the door, head up, smiling. As happy to see me as I am her. Instead I pace back and forth, lamenting. Not entirely understanding why I keep this hope that one day she'll see me like I see her. Every day I think about it, makes me want to disappear. When I'm "off medicaction" I can't seem to see the good in this world. The interest. In turn I find myself to be wholly uninteresting, unattractive, and altogether blah. I dont see any progress. 

I wish I knew what to say to her. I wish I knew how to get out of this loop. It just cycles. She's here, or not here, it doesn't matter. Inside I just assume the worst.
