* JACK and qjackctl:

	While qjackctl provides a MIDI Driver dropdown in the Setup window,
	JACK does not support any MIDI system other than JACK MIDI.  The MIDI
	Driver option in qjackctl should invariably be set to 'none', and not
	'raw', 'seq', or 'alsa_midi'.  JAMRouter is the piece of software
	connecting to natively supported MIDI devices, not JACK.  Keeping
	this one fact in mind will help avoid the common confusion
	surrounding qjackctl's MIDI Driver option.

seems worth looking into
