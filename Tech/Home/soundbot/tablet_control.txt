====== tablet control ======
Created Saturday 05 August 2017



~~build app for android tablet using https://ionicframework.com/~~

~~https://nullr0ute.com/tag/u-boot/~~

~~foot controlled. so two-three boxes~~

~~i guess we could try just using the wirless and netjack or something like that, but also should use usb~~

* ~~switch/change effects~~
* ~~gain control~~
* ~~looper~~
* ~~play samples~~


~~can switch interfaces from foot to push button~~


~~we'll have to gauge the quality/performance of the hardware. running what it is now, it's sluggish. will definietly need to install custom os~~

~~try to incorporate the idea of using a rasp pi to offload some stuff...~~
