non-session-manager would start

[b08x@qubert ~]$ non-session-manager 
[non-session-manager] Starting daemon...
X_ChangeProperty: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) 0x0
[nsmd] Session root is: /home/b08x/NSM Sessions
NSM_URL=osc.udp://qubert.loaf.org:19522/

however, all option buttons were greyed out

this was due to the fact that qubert.loaf.org resolves to some other IP other than the local

fix: update etc/hosts with a line for host machine to local ip
