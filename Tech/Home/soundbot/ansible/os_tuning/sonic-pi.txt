====== sonic-pi ======
Created Sunday 11 June 2017

when attempting to start sonic-pi-server;


{{{code: lang="ruby" linenumbers="False"
Cannot lock down 107335194 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
Cannot use real-time scheduling (RR/15)(1: Operation not permitted)
}}}


first we'll try; 

from: https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/issues/5191

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo dnf install libcgroup.x86_64 libcgroup-tools.x86_64
}}}



Put this in /etc/cgconfig.conf:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
group rtaudio {
	perm {
		task {
			uid = root;
			gid = audio;
		}
		admin {
			uid = root;
			gid = root;
		}
	}
	cpu {
		cpu.rt_runtime_us = 950000;
	}
}
}}}



This in [[/etc/cgrules.conf:]]
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
@audio:jackd cpu rtaudio/
}}}


---
then in [[/etc/pam.d/gdm-launch-environment]] add;

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
session required pam_limits.so
}}}


then reboot;

when attempting to fire up sonic-pi-server standalone, still getting the realtime scheduling not permitted errors. but when starting sonic-pi via the bin, it works. i think jackd needs to be started before we start sonic-pi


user needs to be added to the jackuser group..
