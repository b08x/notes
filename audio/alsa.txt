====== Pops when starting and stopping playback ======
Some modules (e.g. snd_ac97_codec and snd_hda_intel) can power off your sound card when not in use. This can make an audible noise (like a crack/pop/scratch) when turning on/off your sound card. Sometimes even when move the slider volume, or open and close windows (KDE4). If you find this annoying try modinfo snd_MY_MODULE, and look for a module option that adjusts or disables this feature.

Example: disable the power saving mode and solve cracking sound trough speakers problem, using snd_hda_intel add in /etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf:

options snd_hda_intel power_save=0
The power_save_controller option if set to 'Y' will switch the audio card controller off to conserve power, but it can cause issues when the controller resumes. Setting it to N may reduce the severity of other issues as well.

options snd_hda_intel power_save=0 power_save_controller=N
You can also try it with modprobe snd_hda_intel power_save=0 before.

You may also have to unmute the 'Line' ALSA channel for this to work. Any value will do (other than '0' or something too high).

Example: on an onboard VIA VT1708S (using the snd_hda_intel module) these cracks occured even though 'power_save' was set to 0. Unmuting the 'Line' channel and setting a value of '1' solved the problem.
