Ok we were able to make it. I leave the solution we used here, in case it helps someone.

Intro:
- each track has a VOL and a PAN associated, also the PATH where the track file is.
- VOL: between 0 and 100 (VOL of 50 means that volume is unaffected. VOL of 100 duplicates the volume of the track. VOL of 0 mutes the track).
- PAN: between 0 and 100 (PAN of 50 means that both tracks are unaffected, PAN of 0 means that the left track is muted while the right track is unaffected, PAN of 100 means that the right track is muted while the left track is unaffected).
- all input tracks are mono
- CHANNELS: the number of channels of the output file
- TRACKS: the number of tracks to mix

The process is as follows:
- We take into account the four variables that modify the volume when mixing the tracks (CHANNELS, TRACKS, PAN and VOL).
- We mix each channel separately, applying all volume modifications to each track there.
- We then mix all channels into one.

To calculate the volume modification of each track, we use the following formula:

VOLMODleft = (1/CHANNELS) * (1/squareroot(TRACKS)) * (VOL/50) * (if (PAN > 50) ? (100 - PAN)/50 : 1)

VOLMODright = (1/CHANNELS) * (1/squareroot(TRACKS)) * (VOL/50) * (if (PAN < 50) ? (PAN/50) : 1)

At the end of this calculation, we'll have VOLMODleft1, VOLMODright1, VOLMODleft2, VOLMODright2 ... VOLMODleftTRACKS, VOLMODrightTRACKS
(remember that TRACKS is the number of input tracks we're mixing. If we have 3 tracks, then we end up with three VOLMODleft and three VOLMODright).

Let's suppose we have three tracks to mix.

To create the left audio channel:

sox -m -v VOLMODlefttrack1 track1.mp3 -v VOLMODlefttrack2 track2.mp3 -v VOLMODlefttrack3 track3.mp3 -v VOLMODlefttrack4 track4.mp3 leftchannel.mp3

To create the right audio channel:

sox -m -v VOLMODrighttrack1  track1.mp3 -v VOLMODrighttrack2 track2.mp3 -v VOLMODrighttrack3 track3.mp3 -v VOLMODrighttrack4 track4.mp3 rightchannel.mp3

Then, we just mix the left and the right channels into the output file.

sox -M leftchannel.mp3 rightchannel.mp3 output.mp3



--------------------

his is what I would try reading your description:
Code:
sox -M Track1.wav Track2.wav -v -5db Track3.wav -v -5db Track4.wav Output.wav -remix -m 1v0.5,2v0.2,3v0.5 1v0.4,2v0.6,4v0.5
what this should do:
-M Track1.wav Track2.wav -v -5db Track3.wav -v -5db Track4.wav
should mix track 1 to 4 to a single file containing 4 channels (assuming each file is a mono wav) while lowering the volume of track 3 and 4 by 5dB.
Output.wav
should set the output file.
-remix -m 1v0.3,2v0.2,3v0.5 1v0.2,2v0.3,4v0.5
should remix the 4 input channels to stereo:
1st channel contains 30% of track 1, 20% of track 2 and 50% of track 3
2nd channel contains 30% of track 2, 20% of track 1 and 50% of track 4
while '-m' disables all automatic volume adjustments during the remixing,...

Not sure if this helps, but may be it's a start.
