====== Friday 10 Apr 2020 ======

My eyes are going funny on me. Can't seem to configure the visual aspects of the computer. 
Disabling the application that is designed to adjust settings relating to the ease of eye tension, seemed (seems?) to make things "better" looking for the moment. 

Now I wonder what to do. I'm trying to be mindful of my amphetimine usage. I like the idea of insufulation. When I do it right, it's a fun rush. I'm not sure why I struggle with the idea though. I'm the one who is going to have to deal with the consequences. 

I often get annoyed at the words that come out of my mouth. And sometimes surprised. 

Adjusting "my"workstation is going better. Usually I get frustrated with enumerable details. Especially when there is a piece of the puzzle I don't have yet. My eyes refocus funny again. I often wonder about filters applied to the visual scape. Especially when it comes to how I see people. 

I don't like mulling over the decisions regarding what substance I'll input next. Cigarettes and amphetimines are two that, if I don't have, I am not happy...
I'm looking at this based on how things are, not an idealisied version. 

It's 1:30am. Ingested 15mg to compromise (with) my brain. It's quite possible I'm just...cautious. I know that the more I take, the more pronouced the side effects become, which is uncomfortable. Right now I have the confidence that I'll be just fine without it. 

I can't remember if I smoke as much as I do when I'm not taking amps. I think maybe just slightly less. Right now I'm engaged in "things". This is not the case as much without amps. This particularly annoys me. I loved computers, and the manipulation of sound using them, just plenty without. As a matter of fact, I was usually quite "stoned" while doing so. Well, I live near a college campus and I spend most of my time (when I can) taking amps and studying and/or practicing as much as I can. 

I seem to love learning about concepts however I find the practice of those concepts daunting and I'm often discouraged. 

I think my issues with Ann are mostly resolved. We argued well today. Coupled with our recent heated arguement that ended well, I think I can stop worrying so much about losing her.

I'm going to listen to music now. The body feels all kinds of things. 

I spend most of my engaged in an interal dialouge with my selfs. When I get the notion to engage with others, I struggle. 


It's 4:30 now. I was able to spend some time configuring routing with the ambisonic plugins. Trying a different approach. Instead of each bus havin an encoder, I created a track with a multiencoder and send the signals from each bus to that. There are many ways to setup audio routing, which can be frustrating. 



--------------------

Not sure how to conceptualize ambisonics in terms of the final mastering process. Back when I was learning about networking, I would draw diagrams to help sort out routing. I'm having a difficult time even thinking about how to map out proper routing. 

And right now I feel like I can't remember anything. 

And right now the idea of making sound seems pointless. Technically, I suppose it bothers me that I have to break from the process. This worries me.
