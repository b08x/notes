=== watching a blu ray movie the hard way (aka the linux way) ===

mount -t udf /dev/sr0 /mountpoint

This will at least mount the blu ray disc as a read only filesystem. From here it's not clear how to actually play the files. Neither vlc nor mpv care to open any of the files located
within the mountpoint directory. Will have to see if dd can somehow be used to extract the information into .iso or something.
