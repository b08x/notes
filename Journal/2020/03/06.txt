== bypass password prompt in xfce ==

ever get so annoyed at typing in your password, 14 times in a row that you say 'man, I'm annoy with this.'....
I have.

To bypass having to enter a password for every fucking thing......I mean, ahem....if you feel password protection on your workstation is uncessary and at times, distracting;

achieve something similar to the sudo NOPASSWD option by adding this global rule to the existing polkit rules directory;


â†’ Create the following file as root: /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/49-nopasswd_global.rules

{{{code: lang="ruby" linenumbers="True"
/* Allow members of the sudo group to execute any actions
 * without password authentication, similar to "sudo NOPASSWD:"
 */
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
	if (subject.isInGroup("sudo")) {
		return polkit.Result.YES;
	}
});
}}}

@youtube_dl

to install (and subsquently upgrade) youtube-dl, run this; 

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl
}}}
