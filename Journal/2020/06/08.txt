[ ] configure optimal loading of resources
	I'm hoping a better sequence of loading will curb gpu performance issues
	

https://github.com/deterenkelt/dotfiles

~/.xinitrc - starts i3

~/.xprofile - execute commands at the beginning of the "x session". before the window manager (i3) is started



~/.xresources - set DPI, anti-aliasing, hinting and other X font settings, terminal preferences

~/.xsession - may not be needed

slim -> (xserverrc)-> xinitrc â†’ xresources

Alternatively, there is also ruby-fusumaAUR.

then in ~/.config/fusuma/config.yml you can set something like:

swipe:
  3:
	left:
	  command: "xdotool key alt+Right" # History forward 
	right:
	  command: "xdotool key alt+Left" # History back
	up:
	  command: "xdotool key super" # Activity
	down:
	  command: "xdotool key super" # Activity
  4:
	left:
	  command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down" # Switch to next workspace


	right:
	  command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up" # Switch to previous workspace
	up:
	  command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down" # Switch to next workspace
	down:

@search @fileindex @ranger


installed via. builds a cache of file names using find. set configs in .config/via
or edit [[/usr/local/bin/via-*]]

seems pretty cool;

or using ripgrep with zim Notes and Documents


--------------------

[ ] organize hdd usage

* record to ssd then move to storage
* load samples/soundfonts to ram? (maybe)
* keep library on sata -> copy used media to project/session directory...

	move stuff like documents,pictures, pretty much anything that doesn't require super fast read write....
	
	* instead of [[/home/b08x]] mounted to ssd1 just [[/home/b08x/Studio]]
		* apps can run from ssd0
