=== mouse stuff ===

If desired, one can set variables to configure the "mouse" to respond quicker.

I don't see a need for this yet, but should a time where an obessive attention to optimal configuration is desired, here's something to tweak. 


--------------------


=== intel video driver stuff ===

from; https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics

== X freeze/crash with intel driver ==

Some issues with X crashing, GPU hanging, or problems with X freezing, can be fixed by disabling the GPU usage with the NoAccel option - add the following lines to your configuration file:

  ```Option "NoAccel" "True"```
Alternatively, try to disable the 3D acceleration only with the DRI option:

  ```Option "DRI" "False"```
