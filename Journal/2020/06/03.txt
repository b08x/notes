Day -12
Making a second attempt at "planning". I beleive this is where stupid people set expectations regarding the "future". 

So yeah, I guess I sort of want to be able to plot out tasks and then actually do them. 

I'm waiting for the concept of life spans to alleviate my sense of hurry. It's great. I truly do get to do whatever I want, without real worry. I think this is a result of being able to translate myself better. And for this, the "universe", which is a pervert, rewards me with positive feelings/feedback. I want to talk sarcastic shit about this, because it's a fun method to combat being overwhelmed emotionally. THe universe doesn't need to hear my outpouring of affection. It already knows how I feel naturally and it wants my balls removed so i can be a better man. (meaning I can be wicked now with guilt). Wicked is the middle ground between being a shit and being a sap. being a sap isn't bad, but I dont like how unproductive it makes me feel. I get its love, which is required for motivation. What I enjoy more though is acknowledge in the form of a hello or head nod. 

Welcome back, the "random" guy told me. 

Anywho, magic is real and the celtics look like they'll have a good team this year. 

[ ] Tasks written on paper might be neat, but my hand is very much against this idea and I agree. So workflow for task management. 
  [ insert amazing flow chart here ]

[ ] due dates and appointments, and well schedules in general have never been that great to deal with. i think part of this is because someone else was making the schedule. it seems like i am now making my (or beginning to not hate the idea, even sort of enjoy it) own schedule. this should work out better. so i have to remove the attached crap that says 'why bother scheduling/planning something, i'll just be upset when the time comes'. which results in lots of sleep and cranky time.
