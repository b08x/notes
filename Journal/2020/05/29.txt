====== Friday 29 May 2020 ======

Well, it's June 1st so right away this is being written under false pretenses. 

believing in magic
then forgetting again
the idea of being an artist
when it's something
I must do
is an odd element of controlled behavor control issues
I speak funny
I'd rather come up with new ways to say the old things
cos when you figure out it's the same damn thing
well
the initial high of figuring anything out 
comes with that burden of insignigcane
spelling is a detail that some people concern themselves with
I just read whatever I can
to remote control
at the moment not sure which is worse
hunger, pain, fear

I thought I might try not eating to strengthen my emotional control 
sounds startle easily
hot flashes
just a generally, terrible, feeling.
this wont accomplish anything. 
i'm not going to lose control

everything is more the opposite than I could put together at once
which doesn't seem to bother as much as it used to

now, well, then, I have to do stuff I hate
recording
music
my
self

a fish bowl in a cage?
my lack of motivation scares me, a lot
I usually take this out on Ann as I hold her as someone responsible
she is, but it doesn't matter. All of her "shit" is just reverse training. 
break it down...build it up...repeat. 
thinking about the fact I say this over and over scares me
the sadness/longing feeling that I avoid as much as I possible can scares
I dont have to broadcast anything. 
which, is good, because thats...hard.
but it's something I've told myself I want (or should) do
so I've spent a lot of time...observing. watching. 
being unsure

its funny
being sure isn't as glamorous as the movies
i have to go re-up on my medicinal cigarettes
the breathig exercise that will kill me
which is great. 
I have nothing to worry about. I tell myself for the 1000th
rebooting.W
