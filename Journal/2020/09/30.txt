====== Comparing Sound with Ambisonics ======
@ambisonics 

Currently, the ambisonic decoder is configured to output to 5 speakers + 1 virtual sub

With this setup, any channels sent to the bottom region sounds like something far away. 

Setting the elevation on any channel, to between -60 degrees and -120 degress, you won't hear anything.
[see segment one of screencast]

Viewing the screen shot above, anything in red produces a sound while anything in the grey area is silent. 

==== shifting weights ====

If we shift the weights to "inphase", you'll notice that the red areas toward the back are more faded or less intense.

What I thought was interesting, was that the sound seemed fairly uniform regardless of positioning

Choosing a suitable Ambisonic order
-----------------------------------

The choice of the Ambisonic order is a trade-off between constant source width and smooth panning (low order) and precise localization and bumpier panning getting more similar to VBAP (high order). It’s typical to choose 2nd order for 60° spaced loudspeaker layouts, 3rd for 45°, and 5th order for 30°, respectively. 7th order is the highest you can choose and is suitable for 15° spaced layouts.


Energy distribution and rE source width map
-------------------------------------------

When a decoder was calculated successfully, it’s energy distribution is shown in the loudness map in the bottom left (red). Peak values are visualized in red (up to +3dB) while areas of low energy (down to -3dB) are transparent. The choice of the Ambisonic order will influence the energy distribution.

When double-clicking on the map, it will display the acos-rE source width (green). The brighter the color, the wider the image of a source which is panned to that direction. In general, sources at a loudspeaker position will be smaller (less green) than sources between loudspeakers, as several loudspeaker will try to reproduce the signal.

==== stuff I can't explain yet: ====
[see segment four of screencast]

channels 1&2 are placed at ~45degrees a part. Channels 3&4 (which are loudspeakers placed in the back, are turned all the way down. With this config, the sound seems pretty uniform. 
So, the odd thing, when bringing up channel 3, the left channel is barely audible. Then after bringing up channel 4, neither channel is really audible. Then, bringing up channel 5, the right channel becomes barely audible. If we using the pan balancer in the mixer to shift channel 5 more toward the right, the sound evens out. 


==== a visual reference ====
see segment five of screencast showing various placements in the 1st order. 


** the files are called "comparing 6 and 8 channel...ignore that. 


====== A Reaper Thing ======
@reaper 

If we set recording to be disabled ( see: [[./2020-09-30-172822_1920x1080_scrot.png]] ), then we can still hear the sound coming into the channel without it actually recording. This should be useful if setting up a multiband spliter with zita-lrx
