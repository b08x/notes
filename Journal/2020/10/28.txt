====== Wednesday 28 Oct 2020 ======

Has this day even happened yet? I don't think so. Waiting for something to compile. It's odd how I'll get so excited to get into something, when thinking about it, then when I go to do it, I become overwhelmed, discouraged and generally lose interest in the whole thing altogether. 

Regardless, I muddle through, trying to pick out colors for an operating system. 


--- some time later, hours

"wait, what did I do today???"" exclaimed me.

Well, that was a remarkably empathetic, low toned and firm "yes". __I mean, it made me sit down and continue typing. Regardless if I believe it later, that in itself is actually a very important / big deal.__ I even took time to format it with colors. 

Well, I see what you're doing, which won't be useful for later, but perhaps now. I'll go outside carrying a moist, lumpy, oddly shaped object that was created from stuff we did. 

So now I consider local politics as an exercise in realizing my dream that sim city is a thing you can do, in at least 3 if not more dimensions.
