====== finishing the compilation of Soundbot by a certain time ======

The idea of commiting to a "production schedule" of finishing work on compiling Soundbot (which we'll define later) by the end of this year, and from that point on turning focus on composition/production/engineering/performing of music. 

Part of compiling soundbot is learning the tools I'm choosing to use for the time being. Right now, I think the toolset is pretty great. 
I do enjoy trying out new applications, however I think that unless I'm looking for something specfic, what I have now suits the desired focusus. 

Workflows for each of the disclpines;
compostion; think more pot and cookies and mushrooms
production/eng; amphetimines and coffee and cookies
performing; pot, cookies, amphmethines and cofffee
