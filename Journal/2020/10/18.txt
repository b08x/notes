speakers: when panned to the middle (0) the tone sounds "less full" than when panned to either the left or right speaker. 
headphones: not as noticable, the tone seems muddy when panned in the middle

setting "force mono" almost seems to have the opposite effect, with the earbud (the ones I use most often) headphones...
	
	* this does not seem consistent when switching to the wireless headphones, the tone seems uniform..
		* on second listen, when panned 0, the tone does get loud but it doesn't sound good.

With these settings, the darker parts you'll hear the tamborines, bell, assuming the tapping parts of whatever acoustic drum they're using...
