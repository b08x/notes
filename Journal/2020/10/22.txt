"Get me out of here" said, dr. bob

Realizing he's trapped, I need to nudge him towards the door that he cant see. 

I wonder if it would be good if he actually went outside again, or was reminded that while he loves learning about this place, he is needed back home to take care of something. ~~As that is sort of what he wants.~~ Its hard to tell with him as he seems to enjoy being "in" life. This is what confuses him. For some reason, he had to learn to love this place that he hates. I guess thats how we get to move on. By helping him get back to where he needs to be, while I stay here and support the cause I was desiged to support. 

"Get me out of here" is somewhere in the back of my head. I think the storyline I was creating, was not in the direction of clear eyes. 

I think should outside now. 

I'm going to overprepare and stall.
