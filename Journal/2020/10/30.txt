SO looking at a new perspective; it seems to make more sense that my mind has been tricking me...sort of suddenly realizing. but exactly in the opposite end of that spectrum. 

Meaning; it somehow led me to the substance...which of course< i would be instanstly and forever "addicted" no real choice. When, looking at how afraid of everything I was, seems like it could be just a trick to get me to take my meds. My body would react as if it was really enjoying itself, to get me to go along with it's methods of spirtual reasoning and regeneration. Waking Up....I would use "resurrection". 

the brain sought and found it's answer. It made sure to attach a pretty blonde to the substance. So I would take it, if only to prove to the female, that I'm "not a pussy and can do the drugs". That in fact would be a lie. I was a pussy. hesitant even. (for a nanosecond, as it was common courtesy to not show how eager you are to do the thing.... Which, heh...not so bad looking back on it. yeah. 



SO yeah, tryig to get outside and actually do things....however my obession with entertaining the kids, finds me still in this chair, debating...my memory. Whihch, ya know...in the mode of seemingly completely having memory refreshed (like, re-imaged). 

Playing the role of abusive drug addict, should disperse the bothersome (for me) claims otherwise. How would you watch someone lead a fulfilling, satisfied...but a demon with sexually related matters, and then try to tell them "they have this problem to deal with". sounds like jelous projection for that odd sense satisfacation making sure everyone is as unhappy as you are.
