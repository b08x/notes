SO looking at a new perspective; it seems to make more sense that my mind has been tricking me..but exactly in the opposite end of that spectrum. 

Meaning; it somehow led me to the substance...which of course< i would be instanstly and forever "addicted" no real choice. When, looking at how afraid of everything I was, seems like it could be just a trick to get me to take my meds. My body would react as if it was really enjoying itself, to get me to go along with it's methods of spirtual reasoning and regeneration. Waking Up....I would use "resurrection". 

the brain sought and found it's answer. It made sure to attach a pretty blonde to the substance. So I would take it, if only to prove to the female, that I'm "not a pussy and can do the drugs". That in fact would be a lie. I was a pussy. terrorfied even. Which, heh...not so bad looking back on it.
