So, if you are new to this place, you will no doubt run across a substance known to the natives as "adderall".

Unlike other substances I enjoyed breaking, this one captured my attention in a number of different ways. 

And I would like for this to go for a while, so hopefully I can. 

Today's discussion revolving around the, repurposing of this particular tool ( I do like the idea of baking soda adderall, having said that metaphorical adderall was a fun repreive from a the crushing weight of reality. We had/have/probably will discuss the startegy of the abistinence method. I've always felt bad for people who decided (I believe convinced, for good reasons, however that sort of contradicts my whole "figure it out yourself" mentallity. 

So. In my effort to circumvent the nasty notion of having to live life with such a uncessary worry, the idea of curbing one's enthusiam for anything, but "over doing" the "thing". A method I would not get on board with until years of various attempts lead to what I would almost dare to say, a recovery from a severve...life. Or pysocitic break. Depression? remains to be been.

Which is a misnomer. I already know that part, my trouble is slipping in and out of these skins, trying my best to act casually when I say, I saw "Bob". I heard "Bob" but I am having a difficult time holding on to "Bob". Which //is //fine, as the notion that I'm still in the process of a type of surgical procedure that requires seperated synapses, rewiring...keeps me assured that the "treasure hunt" merely entails performing some of what they call "chores". This word confuses, as it is often attached with a negative "childish" overtone. 


Oh...I almost fully remembered politcs in the sense of seeking __The Metaphor/ __
