====== Wednesday 10 Mar 2021 ======

She's not a green dot. I think the main reason I got so upset at Ann for not being able to act a certain way when I was "disoriented" isn't her fault. I expected that she has the ability to do this, but she does not. She is **Capable **which is entirely different. This is my fault for not knowing the difference. And since I could not explain what I was expecting, nor could I explain or teach how to do it, I thought I had no choice but to threaten. This is obviously stupid and isn't necessary to explain how ineffective this is. It obviously gets me further away from the desired goal. So how to fix this? Plan. Before next dosage talk with Ann and a) she if it's something she's interested in learning and b) go through some scerentios. Which that isn't even required. Just thinking of ideas. OF course it's awful of me to expect her to drop what she is doing to take care of a mistake that I made. Having said that, exceptions should be made as I would in a heartbeat. Which, while as true as that may be, doesn't mean the other person is required to recipricate. It's hard for me in principle to entirely agree with this, but it's true. The expectation is unreasonable. 

~~So I do want to explain to Ann the part about my expectation of her as a "green dot" No need to plan or go beyond that.~~

Partnerds. Don't bring up personal pyschoanalytic stuff. Try to pause before every word spoken. If it seems like something you should/could share with a counselor, save it for that.
