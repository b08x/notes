Wanna help yer shitty kid not be so shitty? Give them a stuffed animal, have them form the personal relationshop with it (as they will naturally). Then after about 6mnths, make it disappear. Let them cry and process the sense of loss we feel when an attachment is separated. Do this several times, speard out of a few of the formative years.
