for some reason;

after say; 2 days of i'd say more than happy productive behavior, i get to a point where i think i want more adderall even though I know it won't achieve the feeling I actually want...so then at that point i just want weird. disassoctions, microsleeps, the notion that reality is something completely different than most of my day to day notions of reality without ?high" amounts of stimulants...as compared to??

amd of course, audiotory hallucaitoins as well as pleasing visual stimuli. 

as all well and good that is, as long as i can contain my fear when i start questioning every single thing we do here. at which point any notions of future action is undesirable and all i care to do is input. 

why isn't this a story? cos, now, we can. yeah, this isn't going the direction i'd like it to. 

the thoughts above aren't inaccurate and in fact...fuck...so many thoughts at once..

having said that, this makes me think this is feeding into my over active insecurity function. to a point where i do degrade my self-esteem so much i no longer believe in anything and i become extremely aggitated if not flat out terrified. 

well no, thats fine. i get it. my problem isn't so much a problem as anything else that i can't immmediately conclude. 

things like not having direct acccess to the internet, catch my attetion...

ok, so what if this notion of having to explain these things isn't what i'm really doing. after all, lameentably, its ~~only~~ practice. 

but what is my function! (as i feel myself get anxious a bit about what my "ultimate goal" in life is.
