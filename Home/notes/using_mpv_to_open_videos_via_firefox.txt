Open With extension

	Install Open With add-on.
	Go to Add-ons > Open With > Preferences.
	Proceed with instructions to install a file in your system and test the installation.
	Click Add browser.
	In the dialog write a name for this menu entry and command to start a video streaming capable player (e.g. /usr/bin/mpv).
	(Optional step) Add needed arguments to the player (e.g. you may want --force-window --ytdl for mpv)
	Right click on links or visit pages containing videos. Select newly created entry from Open With's menu and if the site is supported, the player will open as expected.

The same procedure can be used to associate video downloaders such as youtube-dl.
