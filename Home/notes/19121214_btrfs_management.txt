-> More information can be found on the Arch Wiki page for snapper: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Snapper


-> Additionally, if you plan on using this script with grub-btrfs, you should make your grub directory a subvolume so it isn't reverted when you undo snapshots

The snapshot you are trying to boot into is probably set as read-only.

You can check it with:

$ sudo btrfs property get -ts /path/to/snapshot/
If it returns ro=true, you have to make it writable with:

$ sudo btrfs property set -ts /path/to/snapshot/ ro false
