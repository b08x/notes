load avg seems odd; thinking it might have to do with btfs

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
Btrfs supports transparent and automatic compression. This reduces the size of files as well as significantly increases the lifespan of flash-based media by reducing write amplification. [1][2][3] It can also improve performance, in some cases (e.g. single thread with heavy file I/O), while obviously harming performance in other cases (e.g. multi-threaded and/or CPU intensive tasks with large file I/O). Better performance is generally achieved with the fastest compress algorithms, zstd and lzo, and some benchmarks provide detailed comparisons.
