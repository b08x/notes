@lyrics

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
wide brown eyes
seek the sunrise
dryer in the morning lighrt

she's gone
wander all the night long
shutter like the star's song

2.times do
sad girl
walking in the rain
end

she's sang low
she wrote a tone row
sign like an oboe
she roams, sleeping like a hobo
flyin like a lost crow

}}}
