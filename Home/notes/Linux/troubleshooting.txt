@alsa
plugging usb mic, this shows up;

Sep 26 21:56:19 soundbot systemd-udevd[2513]: Process '/usr/sbin/alsactl -E HOME=/run/alsa restore 1' failed with exit code 99.

@pulse
pulseaudio socket service is set to disabled, however it seems to still autospawn....

 * stop the socket service -^{before} doing anything else seems to prevent pulse from loading automatically...even when launching youtube, the audio is routed through alsa-jack

@TODO
make sure the usbmic doesnt set itself as default...
