The only time that line should read something else is when you are passing raw AC3 or Dolby Digital to an audio receiver or similar device.

This, in addition to having the iec958's unmuted in alsamixer should be all you need to get sound from optical out. The volume of PCM sound is still controlled by the usual mixer sliders whether the output is analog jacks or digital outputs.
