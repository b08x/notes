# not sure if this works, will test later

~~If would like to use a DHCP support for TFTP (TFTP Server Address) server~~
~~dhcp-option=66,"192.168.41.108"~~


====== ddwrt ======

what a fucking pain.

under main setup tab

static dns1 can be set to another internal or use the usual

leave local DNS blank under networksetup/router ip

enable dhcp server
enable dnsmasq for dhcp
use dnsmasq for dns
dhcp-authoritative


under the services tab; 
	under dhcpd server section
	set "used domain" to LAN & WLAN
	set LAN domain to syncopatedtech.net

(add static leases if you like)

enable dnsmasq
enable local dns
enable no dns rebind

expand-hosts
address=/bender.qbase.org/192.168.41.2
ptr-record=2.41.168.192.in-addr.arpa,"bender.qbase.org"

[ ] see if this option needs to be under dhcp'd options or dnsmasq options
dhcp-option=66,"192.168.1.100"
