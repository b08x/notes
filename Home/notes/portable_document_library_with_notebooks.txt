@zim 

either programically link all the docs in the doc root to a page, export using "Map document root to URL"

/var/www/index.html
/var/www/documents/pdf files

~~I cannot remember where in nginx to set it where it would prepend the url (https://bender.syncopatedstudios.net/docs/pdf file) true but irrlevant~~

~~If the document root is /var/www/documents and the setting for index is on, that should work out. ~~
It won't matter in this case; set ngninx with the basic config to point to var/dub dub dub
and the zim export will put the files where they need to be. 
[x] have zim export with links to pdfs in document root
[ ] put together markdown template for export <2021-04-01


{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
If your notebook has a Document Root (see Properties)  you can select what to do with links to files under that document root. Either Link files under document root with full file path, which means files will be linked by their absolute file path, or Map document root to URL, which will result in links with the given URL as prefix. This can be useful when you publish pages as part of a larger website.
