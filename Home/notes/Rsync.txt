====== Rsync ======
Created Tuesday 13 April 2021

* --existing, --ignore-non-existing
	   This  tells  rsync to skip creating files (including directories) that do not
	   exist yet on the destination.  If this option is combined with the  --ignore-
	   existing  option,  no  files  will be updated (which can be useful if all you
	   want to do is delete extraneous files).
