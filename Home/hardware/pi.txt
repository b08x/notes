====== pi ======
Created Wednesday 30 September 2020

Currently, piratebot.qbase.org is running retropie on a pi4

Attached, is a digital to analog convertor (DAC) with 4 push buttons and an lcd screen

Now I understand why I don't usually stop to document this sort of thing. It makes easier sense in 'the head'. 

"of course it's a dac" 
"what's a dac?" 
"oh, I don't know" 
looks up 
"oh. it stands for digital to analog convertor..."

Anyway, supposedly provides for higher sound quality. 

To enable the DAC card itself (after or during doing all the usually linux setup stuff;
 {{{code: lang="ruby" linenumbers="True"
# Enable SPI
raspi-config nonint do_spi 0

# Add necessary lines to config.txt (if they don't exist)
add_to_config_text "gpio=25=op,dh" /boot/config.txt
add_to_config_text "dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac" /boot/config.txt
}}}

# then after the pi user has auto logged in to run level three
startx

If a login manager is desired at some point, sudo apt install lightdm 

* performance is a bit slugish, so will wait until we can pick up a faster SD card
