Space efficiency
The Plasma Netbook shell has been dropped from Plasma 5, see the following KDE forum post. However, you can achieve something similar by editing the file ~/.config/kwinrc adding BorderlessMaximizedWindows=true in the [Windows] section.

Using a Proxy?
If you are using a HTTP(S) proxy you can configure apm to use it by running:

apm config set https-proxy YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS
You can run apm config get https-proxy to verify it has been set correctly.

[ ] install minimalistic look & feel 
[ ] get a better handle on the window management
	[ ] apps are opening on different desktops (unlike xfce where you have to set that)

consult arch kde wiki
