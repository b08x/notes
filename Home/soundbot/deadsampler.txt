# a quick way to create spectrograms with sox
https://gist.github.com/hrywlms/5fca1ab19670363a2d43

- [ ] trim end of file by X %
- [ ] remove and/or add comment
- [ ] sox "do stuff" then open old/new files with tony (or some way compare the sounds)


keep "Default" playlist empty, as that is where converted/imported/edited files will be sent to for now

```
mkdir -pv %D/converted && sox %F %D/converted/%f silence -l 1 0.1 1% -1 4.0 1% && deadbeef --queue %D/converted/%f
```
