XFCE PolicyKit Agent

Bypass password prompt
To achieve something similar to the sudo NOPASSWD option and get authorized solely based on user/group identity, you can create custom rules in /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/. This allows you to override password authentication either only for specific actions or globally. See [1] for an example rule set.

Globally
Create the following file as root:

/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-nopasswd_global.rules
/* Allow members of the wheel group to execute any actions
 * without password authentication, similar to "sudo NOPASSWD:"
 */
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
	if (subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
		return polkit.Result.YES;
	}
});
