* create instruments db
`linuxsampler --create-instruments-db soundbot_instruments.db`


* start linuxsampler poiting to the recently created db
`linuxsampler --instruments-db-location soundbot_instruments.db`

* open fantasia
	`java -jar fantasia.jar`
	


having trouble adding instruments to the database
	after adding an instrument with the option "add all instruments from file"
	it will hang at "updating database directories"...
	
	this thread contains someone having a similar issue;
	https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=210434
	
wondering if maybe just keep the instruments organzied and create lscp files...
	creating a midimap
		in the interest of being able to switch instruments from the keyboard...
			
			suspecting perhaps erronous characters might be an issue
				e.g. an sfz with an opcode like this;
					"The opcode '�L��(�Bg}Ϥ�B�Ē����@�@[[���Z�' is unsupported by libsfz!"

looks like if i just wait a bit, then close jsampl & linuxsamp, then reopenm, the database is actually populated

1) create new midi map, give it a name

2) add new midi instrument to this map...
	open up the database view
	find the instrument to add to the map
		e.g. the map name is "strings"
			right click on the file name
				select add to midi map
					adjust the volume
					use midi bank 0 program 1 for the first instrument added to the map
					load mode - we'll get back to this...
					
	back to the main view
		add a channel
		select the instrument map
		the load instrument
			(this seems kind of redundant but might be resolved once orchestras are figured out)
	
	export sampler configuration and/or midi map
		these will be loaded with linuxsampler...
		


theres a console to look into maybe;

1_ create new orch
	see: adding_instruments_lsamp_fullworkflow01.mp4


jsclassic will save the orchestras but unless the lscp is loaded too, it wont automatically save instruments
