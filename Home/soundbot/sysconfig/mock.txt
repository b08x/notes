Nosync
One of the reasons why mock has always been quite slow is because installing a lot of packages generates heavy IO load. But the main bottleneck regarding IO is not unpacking files from packages to disk but writing Yum DB entries. Yum DB access (used by both yum and dnf) generates a lot of fsync(2) calls. Those don't really make sense in mock because people generally don't try to recover mock buildroots after hardware failure. We discovered that getting rid of fsync improves the package installation speed by almost a factor of 4. Mikolaj Izdebski developed small C library 'nosync' that is LD_PRELOADed and replaces fsync family of calls with (almost) empty implementations. I added support for it in mock. How to activate it? You need to install nosync package (available in rawhide) and for multilib systems (x86_64) you need version for both architectures. Then it can be enabled in mock by setting

config_opts['nosync'] = True
It is requires those extra steps to set up but it really pays off quickly.
