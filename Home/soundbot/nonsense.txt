ya know, the thing we've been working on to do stuff...

implement irq scheduling/cpu affinity 
	
	- perhaps ensuring that the sound card is being used at the highest priority
	

figure out alsa profiles and what not
	- would like to experiment with surround sound at some point


we could utilized the .jackdrc file
	/usr/bin/jackd -P90 -dalsa -r96000 -p512 -n2 -Xseq -D -Chw:PCH,0 -Phw:PCH,1
	
	
look into using schedtool.x86_64
	//Schedtool interfaces with the Linux CPU scheduler. It allows the user to set//
	//and query the CPU-affinity and nice-levels of processes, as well as all//
	//scheduling policies, like batch or real-time (RR/FIFO) classes and//
	//their priorities//
