creating a page with a ":" (colon) in the title, 
will create subpages for everything after the colon (":")


https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook

=== Using the Task List ===


* give the list a tag
	* then add items below

{{{code: lang="markdown" linenumbers="False"
TODO: @intranet
[] do this
[] do that

}}}


* use "!" to add priority. The more exclaimation marks, the higher the priority. In this case "another thing" would be listed at the top


{{{code: lang="markdown" linenumbers="False"
[ ] this !!
[ ] that !!!!
[ ] another thing !!!!!
}}}


* add a start date if you want. do so be prepending 'greater than' to a date in this format: >2020-11-30

{{{code: lang="markdown" linenumbers="False"
TODO: @projectname >2020-11-01
[] do this first
	[] this is a subtask
[] or do this first and go back and use exclaimation points to order tasks
[] yeah, this one should be a priority now that I think about it !

}}}


* when adding tasks, tag it with a relevant topic so info and tasks can be linked
{{{code: lang="markdown" linenumbers="False"
[] a task @relatedtopic
[] configure a thing on the intranet @intranet

}}}
